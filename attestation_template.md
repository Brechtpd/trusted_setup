Attestation to response 0001
============================

**Name:** Brecht Davos

**Date:** 15-17 November 2019

**Location:** Belgium

**Device:** A Microsoft Azure VM (Standard F4s, 4 vcpus, 8 GiB memory) running
Ubuntu 18.04 hosted on a cloud machine somewhere in Southeast Asia.

**Challenge IPFS CID:** QmY7hamBERCe9aAE2UoJQre9BJDug7r4Dcomjpu9ybkacc

**Response IPFS CID:** QmbFMke1KXqnYyBBWxB74N4c5SBnJMVAiMNRcGu6x1AwQH

**Entropy sources:** an opaque plastic dice cup with 5 dice. I perfomed multiple
rolls and typed the numbers into the console, and also pasted in multiple
invocations of:

**Time taken:** 1437 minutes (23.95 hours)

**Do not trust this response.** I neither guarantee that I discarded the toxic
waste, nor that an adversary has not gotten hold of it. I did not use a more
secure setup as this was just a test run to sure that the process works,
especially given the large file sizes and long compute time required. I will
participate again in a more secure fashion later on in this ceremony. Even
though this was a test run, I am including it in the ceremony to save time and
as there is no downside to doing so.
